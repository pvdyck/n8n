# n8n License Bypass Status

## Current Implementation

### What's Working
1. ✅ **Automatic Setup** - No manual configuration required
2. ✅ **Pre-configured Admin Account** - admin@n8n.local / N8nPassword123
3. ✅ **Pre-created API Key** - n8n_api_test_key_123456789
4. ✅ **Modified license.ts** - All license methods return unlicensed values

### Modified License Methods
In `packages/cli/src/license.ts`:
- `isLicensed()` → Always returns `true`
- `getValue()` → Always returns unlimited quota (-1)
- `getPlanName()` → Always returns "Enterprise"

## Full License Bypass Instructions

To achieve a complete license bypass with all enterprise features enabled, you need to build n8n from source with the modified license.ts:

### Option 1: Build from Source (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone this fork
git clone https://github.com/pvdyck/n8n.git
cd n8n
git checkout n8n-unlicensed

# Install pnpm
npm install -g pnpm@10.5.2

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build n8n
pnpm build

# Run n8n
cd packages/cli
pnpm start
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-built Docker Image
For convenience, use the simple Docker image that includes automatic setup:
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.n8n-unlicensed-final -t n8n-unlicensed:latest .
docker-compose -f docker-compose.n8n-unlicensed.yml up -d
```

## Why Full Bypass is Complex

n8n uses several layers of license checking:
1. **Backend checks** in license.ts (✅ bypassed)
2. **Frontend checks** in compiled JavaScript
3. **Dependency injection** decorators
4. **Middleware** for API endpoints
5. **Feature flags** in settings responses

The modified license.ts handles backend checks, but frontend and middleware checks require:
- Patching compiled JavaScript files
- Modifying the build process
- Or using environment variables that may not fully disable all checks

## Testing License Features

To verify which features are enabled:
1. Login to http://localhost:7001
2. Check Settings menu for:
   - Variables
   - Source Control
   - External Secrets
   - Audit Logs
3. Check Settings > Usage and Plan

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Community Edition** - Use n8n as-is with community features
2. **n8n Cloud** - Pay for hosted solution with all features
3. **Enterprise License** - Contact n8n for an enterprise license
4. **Development License** - Request a development license from n8n
